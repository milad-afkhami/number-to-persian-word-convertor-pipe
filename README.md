# Number to Persian Word Converter Pipe

numberToPersianWord is an angular pipe that takes a number(an amount of money) and converts it into Persian words.

## Usage
You can add this pipe to your angular project, or you can use its logic to write a custom method.

>**Note:**
> if you want to convert just a number(not currency) to Persian words, you can simply remove this one line of code from anywhere it exists:   
``output += `ریال `;``
